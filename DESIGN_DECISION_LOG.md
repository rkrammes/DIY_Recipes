## Decision Record: DEC-DESIGN-001

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Decision ID** | DEC-DESIGN-001 |
| **Title** | Adoption of Retro Sci-Fi UI Design System |
| **Date** | 2024-05-04 |
| **Status** | Approved |

### Context
The DIY Recipes application currently lacks a cohesive and distinctive visual identity. The UI is functional but inconsistent, with several sections that don't align with the core purpose (recipe management). The application needs a more engaging and unique design language that reflects its experimental and creative nature.

### Options Considered

1. **Standard Modern UI**
   - **Pros**: Familiar to users, easier implementation, strong accessibility support
   - **Cons**: Lacks distinctiveness, misses opportunity to enhance user engagement, doesn't align with app's experimental nature

2. **Skeuomorphic Design**
   - **Pros**: Resembles physical recipe books, intuitive metaphors
   - **Cons**: Dated design approach, limited for digital-only features, higher implementation complexity

3. **Minimalist Design**
   - **Pros**: Clean, focused interface, easier maintenance
   - **Cons**: May feel generic, doesn't emphasize the experimental nature

4. **Retro Sci-Fi Terminal**
   - **Pros**: Distinctive visual identity, aligns with experimental nature, creates memorable experience, leverages existing terminal-mono theme
   - **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, higher implementation complexity, requires careful accessibility considerations

### Decision
We will implement a retro sci-fi terminal-inspired design system that transforms the application into a futuristic laboratory interface. This design will feature monospace typography, terminal-style UI components, and subtle retro computing effects like scan lines and glowing elements.

### Rationale
1. The terminal aesthetic aligns with the experimental, "DIY lab" nature of the application
2. The existing codebase already contains a terminal-mono theme that can be extended
3. This approach creates a distinctive, memorable user experience that differentiates the product
4. Terminal interfaces inherently emphasize structure and organization, which benefits recipe management
5. The design can incorporate accessibility considerations while maintaining its aesthetic
6. The system will use a consistent terminology that reinforces the sci-fi lab metaphor

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Creates a more immersive and engaging experience that reinforces the experimental nature of DIY recipes
- **Development**: Requires significant styling changes but leverages existing component structure
- **Branding**: Establishes a distinctive visual identity that can extend to other touchpoints
- **Maintenance**: Establishes a clear design system that will guide future development

### Implementation Approach
1. Create a comprehensive design specification
2. Develop core UI components with terminal styling
3. Implement the new layout structure
4. Gradually transform existing features to use the new design system
5. Include accessibility considerations throughout

### Participants
- UI Designer
- UX Researcher
- Front-end Developer

### Related Tasks
- task-1: Redesign main layout with retro sci-fi aesthetic
- task-12: Create design spec for retro sci-fi UI transformation
- task-13: Implement new color palette and typography
- task-14: Create CSS components for terminal UI elements
- task-15: Develop JavaScript utilities for terminal UI interactions

## Decision Record: DEC-DESIGN-002

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Decision ID** | DEC-DESIGN-002 |
| **Title** | Terminology Update for Sci-Fi Theme |
| **Date** | 2024-05-04 |
| **Status** | Approved |

### Context
To fully realize the retro sci-fi terminal aesthetic, we need consistent terminology that reinforces the thematic elements while maintaining clarity for users.

### Options Considered
1. **Maintain Current Terminology**
   - **Pros**: No learning curve for existing users
   - **Cons**: Misses opportunity to reinforce theme

2. **Full Sci-Fi Jargon**
   - **Pros**: Maximum thematic immersion
   - **Cons**: Potential confusion, steep learning curve

3. **Balanced Technical Terminology**
   - **Pros**: Reinforces theme while maintaining clarity, bridges familiar cooking concepts with technical language
   - **Cons**: Still requires some learning for users

### Decision
Implement a balanced technical terminology system that renames key concepts while maintaining clarity:
- Recipes → Formulas
- Ingredients → Elements
- Settings → Control Matrix
- Categories → Classifications
- Instructions → Procedures
- Notes → Annotations
- Create → Synthesize
- Edit → Calibrate

### Rationale
1. The new terminology reinforces the laboratory/scientific theme
2. Terms maintain enough connection to their original meaning to be intuitive
3. Creates a more immersive experience without sacrificing usability
4. Helps differentiate sections of the application

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Enhances thematic consistency while maintaining usability
- **Development**: Requires updates to labels and documentation
- **Content**: Will need to update all UI text and help documentation

### Implementation Approach
1. Create a terminology mapping document
2. Update text content throughout the application
3. Update documentation and help materials
4. Consider a brief onboarding tutorial explaining the new terminology

### Participants
- UX Writer
- UI Designer
- Front-end Developer

### Related Tasks
- task-2: Remove unnecessary sections
- task-4: Transform recipe management into 'Formula Database'
- task-5: Redesign ingredient management as 'Element Library'
- task-3: Consolidate menus and settings into 'Control Matrix'

## Decision Record: DEC-DESIGN-003

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Decision ID** | DEC-DESIGN-003 |
| **Title** | Implementation of Context-Aware Action Panel |
| **Date** | 2024-05-04 |
| **Status** | Approved |

### Context
The right column of the application currently lacks clear purpose and structure. We need a consistent approach to presenting actions relevant to the current context.

### Options Considered
1. **Static Action Menu**
   - **Pros**: Simple implementation, consistent location for actions
   - **Cons**: Shows irrelevant actions, cluttered interface

2. **Floating Action Buttons**
   - **Pros**: Minimizes UI clutter, places actions in context
   - **Cons**: Discoverability issues, potential for overlapping content

3. **Context-Aware Action Panel**
   - **Pros**: Shows only relevant actions, maintains consistent location, aligns with terminal aesthetic
   - **Cons**: Requires more complex implementation logic

### Decision
Implement a context-aware action panel in the right column that dynamically displays relevant actions based on the current selection or view.

### Rationale
1. Maximizes the utility of the right column space
2. Reduces cognitive load by showing only relevant actions
3. Maintains a consistent location for actions
4. Aligns with the terminal aesthetic through command-like presentation
5. Builds upon the existing action-registry.js implementation

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Improves discoverability of relevant actions, reduces cognitive load
- **Development**: Requires implementation of context-awareness system
- **Architecture**: Creates clear separation between content and actions

### Implementation Approach
1. Extend the existing action registry to support context awareness
2. Create a terminal-styled action renderer component
3. Group actions by type (primary, secondary, utility)
4. Implement visual hierarchy within the action panel
5. Ensure keyboard accessibility for all actions

### Participants
- UX Designer
- Front-end Developer

### Related Tasks
- task-7: Implement context-aware action panel styled like retro terminal
- task-14: Create CSS components for terminal UI elements
- task-15: Develop JavaScript utilities for terminal UI interactions
