## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to migrating the DIY Recipes application to a modern architecture with a hybrid MCP server integration strategy. By adopting this approach, we can leverage the benefits of official MCP implementations where available while maintaining reliability through custom implementations where needed.

The plan is designed to be flexible, allowing for adjustments based on discoveries made during the implementation process and changes in the availability or capabilities of official MCP servers. Regular reviews and adjustments to the timeline may be necessary as the project progresses.
