   - Ensure proper state management for recipe data

3. **Settings & Theme System**
   - Implement settings panel with React components
   - Create theme context and provider
   - Migrate authentication UI
   - Implement edit mode toggle functionality

### Week 7-9: Advanced Features & Refinement

#### Tasks:
1. **Ingredient Management**

   - Ensure proper state management for iterations

3. **UI Polish & Accessibility**
   - Implement responsive design improvements
   - Ensure accessibility compliance
   - Add animations and transitions
   - Implement error handling and feedback systems

### Week 10-12: Testing, Optimization & Launch

#### Tasks:
1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Implement end-to-end tests with Cypress or similar
   - Ensure all user flows are covered
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios
   - Verify accessibility compliance

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement image optimization
   - Configure proper code splitting and bundle optimization
   - Implement server-side rendering for appropriate pages
   - Optimize API calls and data fetching

3. **Launch Preparation**
   - Set up analytics and monitoring
   - Prepare documentation for the new system
   - Create user migration plan
   - Configure production environment

## Parallel Running Strategy (2-4 Weeks)

### Tasks:
1. **Dual Deployment Setup**
   - Configure both applications to run simultaneously
   - Set up routing to direct users to appropriate version
   - Implement feature flags for gradual rollout

2. **Data Synchronization**
   - Ensure both applications can access the same data
   - Implement data migration scripts if needed
   - Test data integrity across both systems

3. **User Migration**
   - Create user communication plan
   - Implement opt-in mechanism for early access
   - Collect feedback from early adopters
   - Plan for full cutover timing

## Technical Considerations

### State Management
- Consider React Context for simpler state needs
- Evaluate Redux Toolkit for more complex state management
- Ensure proper data normalization and caching

### API Design
- Use RESTful principles for API endpoints
- Consider GraphQL for more flexible data requirements
- Implement proper error handling and status codes
- Use TypeScript interfaces for request/response types

### Performance
- Implement code splitting at the route level
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized images
- Configure proper caching headers
- Implement incremental static regeneration where appropriate

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components and utilities
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Performance and accessibility testing

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks:
1. **Data Migration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing and validation scripts

2. **User Adoption Resistance**
   - Mitigation: Clear communication and gradual rollout

3. **Performance Regression**
   - Mitigation: Establish baselines and regular performance testing

4. **Timeline Slippage**
   - Mitigation: Modular approach allowing partial deployments

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics:
- Lighthouse performance score improvement

- Load time improvement
- Test coverage percentage

### User Experience Metrics:
- Reduced error rates
- Improved user engagement
- Faster task completion times
- Positive user feedback

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team:
- 2-3 Frontend Developers (React/Next.js experience)

- 1 UX/UI Designer (component design, accessibility)
- 1 QA Engineer (testing, automation)

### Infrastructure:
- Vercel for hosting (current and new application)
- Supabase (retained from current architecture)
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to migrating the DIY Recipes application to a modern architecture. By following this phased approach, we can minimize risk while steadily improving the application's architecture, performance, and maintainability.

The plan is designed to be flexible, allowing for adjustments based on discoveries made during the implementation process. Regular reviews and adjustments to the timeline may be necessary as the project progresses.
