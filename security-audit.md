# Security Audit Report - DIY Recipes Application

## Executive Summary

This security audit has identified several critical and high-severity security vulnerabilities in the DIY Recipes application. The most concerning issues include exposed credentials in client-side code, lack of input validation and sanitization, potential XSS vulnerabilities, and missing security headers. These issues could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database, inject malicious code, or manipulate user data.

## Vulnerabilities by Severity

### Critical

1. **Hardcoded Credentials in Client-Side Code** 
   - **Location**: `js/supabaseClient.js` (lines 8-9)
   - **Description**: The Supabase URL and anonymous key are hardcoded directly in client-side JavaScript that is sent to all users.
   - **Impact**: Anyone can extract these credentials and gain direct access to the database with anonymous privileges.
   - **Recommendation**: Store credentials only in environment variables on the server-side. Use server endpoints to perform authenticated operations.

2. **Sensitive Credentials in .env File**
   - **Location**: `.env` file
   - **Description**: The .env file contains actual Supabase service role key with full database access.
   - **Impact**: If the repository is public or the .env file is accidentally committed, attackers gain complete access to the database.
   - **Recommendation**: Add .env to .gitignore (which is currently missing), use .env.example for structure only, and never commit real credentials.

3. **No CSRF Protection**
   - **Location**: Application-wide
   - **Description**: No CSRF tokens are implemented for form submissions or API requests.
   - **Impact**: Attackers can perform actions on behalf of authenticated users.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations.

### High

1. **Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities** 
   - **Location**: `js/ui.js` (lines 457, 470, 473, 476, 480, and others)
   - **Description**: Unsanitized user input is directly inserted into the DOM using innerHTML.
   - **Impact**: Attackers can inject and execute malicious JavaScript.
   - **Recommendation**: Replace innerHTML with textContent where possible, or use a library like DOMPurify to sanitize HTML.

2. **Insufficient Input Validation**
   - **Location**: `js/api.js` (line 247), `server.js` (line 37)
   - **Description**: User-provided JSON is parsed without validation in parseCSVData.
   - **Impact**: Potential JSON injection vulnerabilities and application crashes.
   - **Recommendation**: Validate all user input before processing, use schema validation libraries.

3. **Missing Security Headers**
   - **Location**: `server.js`
   - **Description**: No security headers like Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, etc.
   - **Impact**: Increased vulnerability to various attacks including XSS and clickjacking.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement security headers using a library like Helmet.js.

4. **No CORS Configuration**
   - **Location**: `server.js`
   - **Description**: No explicit CORS policy is defined.
   - **Impact**: Potential for cross-origin attacks if browser defaults are too permissive.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement a strict CORS policy allowing only trusted origins.

### Medium

1. **Insecure Error Handling**
   - **Location**: `server.js` (line 30), throughout codebase
   - **Description**: Error details are logged to the console but generic messages are returned to users.
   - **Impact**: While good for security, it makes debugging difficult in production.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement proper error logging with unique error IDs that can be referenced.

2. **Lack of Rate Limiting**
   - **Location**: Application-wide, particularly authentication endpoints
   - **Description**: No rate limiting on authentication or API endpoints.
   - **Impact**: Vulnerability to brute force attacks and DoS.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement rate limiting on all endpoints, especially authentication.

3. **Insufficient Authentication Logging**
   - **Location**: `js/auth.js`
   - **Description**: Limited logging of authentication events.
   - **Impact**: Difficult to detect and investigate suspicious login attempts.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive logging for all authentication events.

### Low

1. **Verbose Error Messages**
   - **Location**: Throughout codebase (e.g., `js/api.js` line 29)
   - **Description**: Detailed error messages are logged to the console.
   - **Impact**: Could leak implementation details if console logs are accessible.
   - **Recommendation**: Use more generic error messages in production environments.

2. **Lack of Password Policy**
   - **Location**: Authentication system
   - **Description**: Using Supabase magic links is good, but no fallback password policy is defined if password auth is enabled.
   - **Impact**: If password auth is enabled, weak passwords could be used.
   - **Recommendation**: Enforce strong password policies if password authentication is enabled.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Hardcoded Credentials in Client-Side Code

```javascript
// supabaseClient.js
// Use the actual Supabase URL and the PUBLIC ANONYMOUS KEY
const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://bzudglfxxywugesncjnz.supabase.co';
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImJ6dWRnbGZ4eHl3dWdlc25jam56Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDE4Mjk5MDAsImV4cCI6MjA1NzQwNTkwMH0.yYBWuD_bzfyh72URflGqJbn-lIwrZ6oAznxVocgxOm8';
```

The application initializes the Supabase client directly in client-side code with hardcoded credentials. While this is using the "anonymous" key which has restricted permissions, it's still a security risk as it allows anyone to make direct API calls to your Supabase instance with these credentials.

### 2. XSS Vulnerabilities via innerHTML

```javascript
// js/ui.js - line 457
recipeDescriptionEl.innerHTML = recipe.description ? `<p>${recipe.description}</p>` : '<p>No description provided.</p>';

// js/ui.js - line 470-471
let instructionsHtml = '<ol>';
const steps = recipe.instructions.split('\n').filter(step => step.trim() !== '');
steps.forEach(step => {
    instructionsHtml += `<li>${step}</li>`;
});
instructionsHtml += '</ol>';
detailedInstructionsEl.innerHTML = instructionsHtml;
```

The application directly inserts user-provided content into the DOM using innerHTML without any sanitization. This creates a risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if a malicious user can save a recipe with JavaScript code in the description or instructions.

### 3. Insufficient Input Validation

```javascript
// js/api.js - line 247
ingredients: JSON.parse(row[ingredientsIndex] || '[]'),
```

The application parses JSON from CSV data without proper validation. If an attacker can upload a malformed CSV file, they could potentially cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

### 4. Missing Security Headers and CORS Configuration

The Express server in `server.js` does not implement any security headers or explicit CORS policy. This leaves the application vulnerable to various attacks including XSS, clickjacking, and cross-origin request forgery.

## Recommendations

### Short-term Fixes

1. **Remove Hardcoded Credentials**:
   - Move all Supabase interactions to server-side code
   - Use environment variables for all credentials
   - Create a .gitignore file and ensure .env is included

2. **Fix XSS Vulnerabilities**:
   - Replace innerHTML with textContent where possible
   - Use DOMPurify to sanitize any HTML that needs to be rendered
   - Implement a Content Security Policy

3. **Implement Basic Security Headers**:
   - Add Helmet.js to the Express app to enable standard security headers
   - Configure a strict CORS policy

### Medium-term Improvements

1. **Implement Input Validation**:
   - Add schema validation for all user inputs
   - Sanitize all data before storing or displaying it

2. **Enhance Authentication Security**:
   - Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints
   - Implement comprehensive logging for authentication events

3. **Secure Data Handling**:
   - Review and improve error handling
   - Implement proper data validation before database operations

### Long-term Recommendations

1. **Security Testing**:
   - Conduct regular security audits
   - Implement automated security testing in the CI/CD pipeline

2. **User Security Education**:
   - Provide guidelines for users on creating secure content
   - Implement content moderation for shared recipes

3. **Monitoring and Incident Response**:
   - Set up monitoring for suspicious activities
   - Develop an incident response plan for security breaches
