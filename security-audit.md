# Security Audit for Authentication and Settings System

## Overview

This document outlines security considerations and best practices for implementing the authentication and settings system in the DIY Recipes application. The goal is to ensure secure user authentication, proper permission management, and protection against common security vulnerabilities.

## Authentication Security

### Magic Link Authentication

The application uses Supabase's magic link authentication, which has several security advantages:

1. **No Password Storage**: Since the system uses passwordless authentication via magic links, there's no risk of password leaks or weak passwords.

2. **Limited Token Validity**: Magic link tokens should have a short expiration time (typically 1 hour or less) to limit the window of vulnerability if a link is intercepted.

3. **Single-Use Tokens**: Each magic link should be usable only once, preventing replay attacks.

### Implementation Recommendations

1. **Secure Email Handling**:
   - Ensure email addresses are validated before sending magic links
   - Implement rate limiting for magic link requests to prevent abuse
   - Consider adding CAPTCHA for unauthenticated requests if spam becomes an issue

2. **Token Security**:
   - Do not expose authentication tokens in URLs (already handled by Supabase)
   - Store tokens securely using HTTP-only cookies or secure local storage
   - Implement proper CSRF protection

3. **Session Management**:
   - Implement session timeout (idle timeout of 30-60 minutes recommended)
   - Provide clear logout functionality
   - Invalidate sessions on the server side when users log out

## Authorization Controls

### Edit Mode Permissions

1. **Strict Authentication Check**:
   - Edit mode should only be available to authenticated users
   - All edit operations must verify authentication state before proceeding
   - Server-side validation must be implemented for all edit operations

2. **UI Protection**:
   - Edit UI elements should not be rendered for unauthenticated users
   - Edit-related endpoints should reject requests from unauthenticated sessions

3. **Audit Logging**:
   - Consider implementing audit logs for edit operations
   - Track which user made which changes for accountability

## Client-Side Security

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs on both client and server sides
   - Sanitize data to prevent XSS attacks
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive details
   - Use generic error messages for authentication failures
   - Log detailed errors server-side for debugging

3. **Content Security**:
   - Consider implementing Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Avoid inline scripts where possible
   - Use HTTPS exclusively

## Supabase Security Configuration

1. **Row-Level Security (RLS)**:
   - Implement RLS policies in Supabase to restrict data access based on user ID
   - Ensure unauthenticated users can only read public data
   - Verify write operations are restricted to authenticated users

2. **API Key Management**:
   - Use only the public anon key in client-side code
   - Keep service role key secure and never expose it in client-side code
   - Consider environment-specific API keys for development vs. production

3. **Database Schema Security**:
   - Use foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity
   - Implement proper indexing for security-critical queries
   - Consider using views to restrict access to sensitive fields

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Security Testing**:
   - Test authentication bypass scenarios
   - Verify that unauthenticated users cannot access protected features
   - Test for common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, injection)

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test with expired sessions
   - Test concurrent login scenarios
   - Test with malformed authentication tokens

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify that authentication state is consistent across page reloads
   - Test that edit mode correctly reflects authentication state
   - Verify that server-side validation works correctly

## Monitoring and Incident Response

1. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitor failed authentication attempts
   - Set up alerts for unusual authentication patterns
   - Track usage of edit functionality

2. **Incident Response**:
   - Develop a plan for handling potential security breaches
   - Implement the ability to force-logout all users if needed
   - Document procedures for revoking and rotating compromised credentials

## Regular Review

Schedule regular security reviews to ensure:
- Authentication mechanisms remain up-to-date
- New features follow security best practices
- Dependencies are kept updated to patch security vulnerabilities
