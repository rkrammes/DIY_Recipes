# CONTRIBUTING.md

## Overview

Thank you for contributing to the DIY Recipes project. This document outlines the guidelines and procedures for our collaboration. It is designed to ensure that every update is precise, transparent, and consistent with the project’s objectives.

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Whole File Delivery
- **Complete Files Only:**  
  Every file provided during our collaboration will be complete and ready to copy-paste into the repository. This includes configuration files containing authentication keys or any other necessary data.
- **Data Verification:**  
  At every step, the actual files on GitHub must be reviewed to ensure that the intended changes are fully and accurately applied. Any discrepancies must be addressed immediately.

### High-Level Summaries & Incremental Updates
- **High-Level Summaries:**  
  Before making any updates, a high-level summary will be provided. This summary explains:
  - The modifications made.
  - The rationale behind these changes.
  - How the changes align with the project’s objectives.
- **Incremental Updates:**  
  We will work on one document at a time. After delivering an updated file and accompanying instructions, you will be prompted for confirmation or feedback before we proceed to the next document.

### Consistency in Data Verification
- **Regular Checks:**  
  Every update requires verification against the actual GitHub data to ensure no information is missing or misaligned.
- **Feedback Loop:**  
  After each update, review the entire file to confirm it meets expectations. Prompt feedback is required before moving on to subsequent updates.

### Authentication and Public Data
- **Editing Rights Control:**  
  Authentication in this project is used solely to control editing rights. It does not impact the public accessibility of the recipe and ingredient data.
- **Public Data Integrity:**  
  All recipe and ingredient data remains public and must be accessible regardless of a user’s authentication state. Any modifications to authentication logic must not inadvertently alter data visibility.

## Workflow

1. **Initial Repository Review**
   - Begin by reviewing the current state of the repository on GitHub to ensure all files are up to date.

2. **Update Process**
   - A high-level summary of the intended change will be provided.
   - The complete updated file will be delivered.
   - You will review the file and confirm its correctness before we move on to the next document.

3. **Ongoing Verification**
   - After each update, verify that the changes have been correctly applied by comparing with the actual GitHub files.
   - Provide feedback, and any necessary adjustments will be made promptly.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure a clear, consistent, and reliable development process for the DIY Recipes project. Every update is verified against the actual data on GitHub, and each change is delivered as a complete file ready for immediate use. Please review this document and let us know if any modifications are required before proceeding to the next update.
