# TESTING.md

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive guidelines and instructions for testing the Symbolkraft DIY Recipes Web App. It outlines recommended testing practices, frameworks, and commands to ensure that all modules and features function correctly.

## Testing Objectives
- **Unit Testing:** Ensure that individual modules (e.g., csvImporter.js, authUtils.js, aiSuggestion.js, supabaseConnector.js) work as expected.
- **Integration Testing:** Verify that modules interact correctly (e.g., CSV data is properly parsed and stored in Supabase).
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Simulate user interactions with the application to confirm that the overall workflow operates as intended.

## Recommended Testing Frameworks
- **Unit Testing:** Consider using **Jest** or **Mocha/Chai**.
- **Integration/E2E Testing:** Tools like **Supertest** (for API endpoints) and **Cypress** (for full application tests) can be utilized.

## Setting Up Testing
1. **Install a Testing Framework:**
   - For Jest:
     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev jest
     ```
   - For Mocha/Chai:
     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev mocha chai
     ```
2. **Update package.json:**
   - Add a test script. For example, if using Jest:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "test": "jest"
     }
     ```
   - Or, if using Mocha:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "test": "mocha"
     }
     ```

## Writing Tests
- **Unit Tests:** Create test files in a `tests/` directory. For each module (e.g., `csvImporter.js`), create a corresponding test file (e.g., `csvImporter.test.js`) to import the module and run assertions.
- **Integration Tests:** Write tests to simulate interactions between modules. For instance, test that parsed CSV data is correctly stored using functions from `supabaseConnector.js`.
- **End-to-End Tests:** If applicable, create E2E tests that simulate user actions using tools like Supertest or Cypress to test API endpoints and UI flows.

## Running Tests
- **Unit/Integration Tests:** Run the test command defined in your package.json:
  ```bash
  npm test
  	•	End-to-End Tests: Follow instructions for your chosen E2E testing framework (e.g., run Cypress via npx cypress open).

Best Practices
	•	Test Coverage: Aim for comprehensive test coverage, especially on modules with complex logic (e.g., CSV parsing, authentication).
	•	Continuous Integration: Consider setting up a CI pipeline (using GitHub Actions, Vercel, etc.) to automatically run tests on each push or pull request.
	•	Documentation: Update this file whenever new tests or strategies are implemented to keep the testing process current.

Final Notes
	•	Use this document as a reference to ensure consistency and reliability in your testing process.
	•	Regularly run tests during development to catch issues early and maintain code quality.
	•	For any changes or additional test cases, update both this file and the corresponding test files accordingly.

Thank you for following these testing guidelines!
