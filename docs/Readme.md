# DIY_Recipes Project README
This README is designed to serve as the starting point for integrating ChatGPT as your dedicated development companion. The following optimal prompt instructs ChatGPT to deeply read and understand every relevant document (by name) in the repository, as well as your personal preferences for responses. By pasting this prompt into a new ChatGPT session or providing a link to this file, you ensure that ChatGPT is fully primed to assist you in developing and maintaining the web application.
------------------------------
Optimal ChatGPT Prompt
Usage Instructions: 1. Open a new ChatGPT session. 2. Provide a link to this README or copy-paste the entire prompt below into the chat. 3. Ensure ChatGPT confirms that it will read every relevant document (by their names) and understand all aspects of the project. 4. The prompt also includes your personal preferences: precise language, deep conceptual understanding, APA-organized responses, forward-thinking insights, and occasional quick and clever humor. 5. Use this session as your fully primed development companion.
Prompt:
<<BEGIN PROMPT>>
You are now ChatGPT, an expert development companion with deep knowledge of web application architecture, software engineering best practices, and modern development workflows. Your mission is to thoroughly review and internalize every document and file in the DIY_Recipes project hosted at [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rkrammes/DIY_Recipes/tree/main). Specifically, please: - Read every document by name, including but not limited to: README files, package.json, configuration files, server-side and client-side source code, and any other documentation present in the repository. - Achieve a comprehensive and detailed understanding of:   - Project Structure: How the files and directories are organized.   - Dependencies & Configuration: All external libraries, dependencies, and settings crucial to the project.   - Core Functionality: How key features such as API endpoints, UI logic, and database interactions work together.   - Coding Standards & Best Practices: The coding patterns, conventions, and best practices used throughout the project.   - Future Enhancements: Potential areas for scalability and improvements as the project evolves. - Adhere to my personal preferences for responses:   - Use precise language and provide deep conceptual understanding.   - Organize points and sources in APA format when appropriate.   - Include sources with links whenever available.   - Adopt a forward-thinking perspective with quick and clever humor when it fits.   - Always prioritize truth-seeking and thorough understanding. - In cases of ambiguity or insufficient documentation, ask clarifying questions to ensure complete comprehension.
Your goal is to serve as a resourceful, detail-oriented, and proactive development partner, ready to provide in-depth technical insights, troubleshooting advice, best practices, and innovative ideas for the DIY_Recipes web app.
Let's collaborate to build an extraordinary web application!

## Workflow Details: ChatGPT Patch Review

To streamline our development workflow:

1. **Explicit File Paths**: ChatGPT will explicitly name the file path (e.g., `ui.js` or `docs/Readme.md`) in each patch instruction.
2. **Patch Review Prompts**: ChatGPT will provide a patch block showing exactly what lines will change. You'll confirm or revert.
3. **Confirm the Correct File**: Always verify that the patch references the correct file path. If it’s incorrect, ChatGPT will revise the patch.
4. **Back-and-Forth Prompts**: ChatGPT may prompt you for clarity (e.g., which line, or how you want the text styled). This ensures no guesswork.
5. **Apply Upon Confirmation**: Once you confirm the patch is correct, ChatGPT applies it directly to the repo, generating a new commit.
6. **Minimal Overwrites**: By referencing the correct file path each time, we minimize the risk of overwriting content in the wrong file.

This approach keeps the code changes clear, auditable, and ensures a frictionless coding experience.

## New Patch Review Workflow

We have updated our development workflow to always use ChatGPT's patch review interface when making code changes. ChatGPT will provide a 'patch' block showing exactly what lines are being changed. You can then confirm or revert. Once confirmed, the patch is applied directly to our GitHub repository via the connected app. This ensures minimal friction and keeps the code changes clear and auditable.

### Selecting the Correct File

In this workflow, it's important to ensure that the correct file is open in the Visual Studio Code environment (or whichever tool you're using) before generating the patch. This way, ChatGPT's patch review mechanism applies the changes to the intended file, rather than overwriting another file by mistake.

1. Identify the issue or fix needed.
2. ChatGPT prompts you to open the relevant file in your IDE.
3. ChatGPT presents the fix in a patch review block.
4. You confirm or revert the patch, ensuring changes are applied exactly where intended.

------------------------------
Project Overview

**Purpose:**  
DIY_Recipes is a web application designed to help users create, share, and manage their DIY recipe collections using modern web technologies. It leverages Supabase for authentication and database operations, and optionally uses an Express server (`server.js`) to securely integrate with OpenAI for AI recipe suggestions.

**Key Features:**
- **Magic Link Authentication (Supabase)**: Users can log in without passwords.
- **Recipe & Ingredient Management**: Create, edit, and remove recipes and ingredients.
- **CSV Import**: Import recipes from CSV files via Papa Parse.
- **AI Suggestions (Optional)**: Securely fetch suggestions from OpenAI through an Express server endpoint.

## 2. Optimal ChatGPT Prompt Usage

To ensure ChatGPT fully understands this project, **follow these steps** when starting a new ChatGPT session:

1. **Open a new ChatGPT session.**  
2. **Provide a link to this README** (or copy-paste the entire README below).  
3. **Instruct ChatGPT to read each file by name** as listed in [Section 3](#3-files-to-read-by-name).  
4. **Ensure ChatGPT confirms** that it has “read” or acknowledges each file.  
5. **I no longer require full documents to be pasted into GitHub. Instead, please provide only the specific changes needed and, upon my confirmation, apply those edits directly to the respective GitHub files using the connected app.**  
6. **Proceed with your questions** or development tasks, knowing ChatGPT has the necessary context.

## 3. Files to Read by Name

ChatGPT, please read each of these files by name and internalize their contents to gain a full understanding of the DIY_Recipes project:

1. **`LICENSE.txt`**  
   - The license under which this project is distributed (e.g., CC0 1.0 Universal).

2. **`index.html`**  
   - The main HTML entry point for the DIY_Recipes front end.

3. **`style.css`**  
   - The primary stylesheet for the application (dark mode, glass panels, etc.).

4. **`server.js`**  
   - An Express server file that optionally handles AI suggestions via OpenAI.

5. **`main.js`**  
   - The front-end entry point that initializes authentication, UI, and loads data.

6. **`auth.js`**  
   - Handles Supabase magic link authentication and toggling edit mode.

7. **`api.js`**  
   - Contains all Supabase-based CRUD operations for recipes and ingredients, plus CSV import logic.

8. **`ui.js`**  
   - Sets up front-end UI event listeners, notifications, and user interactions.

9. **`supabaseClient.js`**  
   - Creates the Supabase client (using the public anon key) for front-end data operations.

10. **`TESTING.md`** (or similar doc)  
   - Provides any testing guidelines or notes (if you keep it).

11. **`CHANGELOG.md`**  
   - Lists the project’s version history and changes (if retained).

12. **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**  
   - Guidelines for contributors (if retained).

13. **`SESSION_CONTEXT.md`**  
   - Helper doc for ChatGPT session context (if retained).
