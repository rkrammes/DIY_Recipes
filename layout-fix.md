# DIY Recipes Layout Fix

## Overview
The DIY Recipes app uses a responsive CSS Grid layout with three columns:
- **Left Column** (`.left-column`): navigation and ingredients.
- **Middle Column** (`.middle-column`): recipe details.
- **Right Column** (`.right-column`): metadata, iterations, editing.

The grid is defined as:
```css
.content-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: minmax(250px, 1fr) 3fr minmax(250px, 1fr);
}
```

## Issue
Only the left column was visible. The middle and right columns were hidden or collapsed due to:
- The **middle column content** being hidden by default (`display: none`) until a recipe is selected.
- The **right column** being empty and containing an invalid stray `</div>`, causing rendering issues.
- No explicit minimum widths or growth rules to prevent collapse.

## Fixes Applied
- Removed invalid nested `</div>` inside the right column `<aside>`.
- Added placeholder content to `.right-column` to maintain visibility.
- Applied CSS fixes:
  - Enforced minimum widths for middle and right columns.
  - Ensured grid columns do not collapse.
  - Verified media queries to maintain responsiveness.

## Layout Behavior
- **Above 1100px:** Three columns displayed.
- **900px - 1100px:** Two columns, right column stacked below.
- **Below 900px:** Single column stacked vertically.

## Result
All three columns now display properly on large screens, with responsive behavior intact. Recipe details appear when selected, and the right column remains visible for future content.
