## Using MCP Servers for Specific Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Analysis

```
// Example: Using Supabase MCP to analyze database schema
// This would be implemented as a Node.js script that calls the MCP
const analyzeDatabase = async () => {
  // Get all schemas
  const schemas = await supabaseMCP.callTool('get_schemas', {});
  
  // For each schema, get tables
  for (const schema of schemas.data) {
    const tables = await supabaseMCP.callTool('get_tables', {
      schema_name: schema.name
    });
    
    // Generate comprehensive report
    // ...
  }
};
```

### 2. Competitor Research

```
// Example: Using Firecrawl MCP to analyze competitor websites
const analyzeCompetitors = async () => {
  const competitors = [
    'https://www.allrecipes.com',
    'https://www.epicurious.com',
    'https://www.food.com'
  ];
  
  for (const site of competitors) {
    // Extract site structure
    const siteMap = await firecrawlMCP.callTool('firecrawl_map', {
      url: site,
      limit: 100
    });
    
    // Analyze recipe pages
    // ...
  }
};
```

### 3. Visual Regression Testing

```
// Example: Using Screenshotone MCP for visual regression testing
const visualRegressionTest = async () => {
  // Capture screenshots of current application
  const beforeScreenshot = await screenshotoneMCP.callTool('render-website-screenshot', {
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/recipes/1'
  });
  
  // After implementing changes, capture new screenshots
  // Compare screenshots and report differences
  // ...
};
```

### 4. Automated UI Testing

```
// Example: Using Puppeteer MCP for automated UI testing
const testUserFlow = async () => {
  // Navigate to the application
  await puppeteerMCP.callTool('puppeteer_navigate', {
    url: 'http://localhost:3000'
  });
  
  // Click on a recipe
  await puppeteerMCP.callTool('puppeteer_click', {
    selector: '.recipe-item:first-child'
  });
  
  // Verify recipe details are displayed
  // ...
};
```

## Implementation Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Incomplete Understanding of Current Architecture
**Mitigation**: Use Filesystem MCP and Supabase MCP to thoroughly analyze the current codebase and database before beginning migration.

### Risk: Feature Regression During Migration
**Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive testing with Puppeteer MCP and Screenshotone MCP to catch regressions early.

### Risk: Data Loss During Migration
**Mitigation**: Use Supabase MCP to create and test migration scripts thoroughly before applying to production data.

### Risk: Developer Learning Curve
**Mitigation**: Use Brave Search MCP to research best practices and create comprehensive documentation.

## Success Metrics

- **Code Quality**: Improved maintainability scores in static analysis
- **Performance**: 50% improvement in page load times
- **Developer Experience**: Reduced time to implement new features
- **User Experience**: Improved usability and satisfaction scores
- **Maintainability**: Reduced time to implement bug fixes and updates

## Conclusion

This MCP-assisted upgrade plan provides a structured approach to modernizing the DIY Recipes application using MCP servers as development tools. By leveraging these powerful capabilities, we can accelerate the upgrade process, reduce risks, and ensure a high-quality result.

The plan emphasizes using MCP servers for:
1. Analysis and research to inform architectural decisions
2. Automation of repetitive development tasks
3. Testing and validation of the upgraded application
4. Documentation and knowledge management throughout the process

This approach allows us to focus on the core migration challenges while letting MCP servers handle many of the supporting tasks, resulting in a more efficient and effective upgrade process.
