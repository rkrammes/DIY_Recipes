# Running Your App on localhost:3000

There seems to be a networking issue on your machine that prevents servers from binding properly to localhost. Here's a comprehensive guide to get your application running:

## Option 1: Simple HTTP Server

```bash
cd modern-diy-recipes
node simple-http-server.js
```

This will start a simple HTTP server on port 8080. You can access it at:
http://localhost:8080

## Option 2: Next.js Server

```bash
cd modern-diy-recipes
npm run server
```

This starts the full application with Next.js on port 3000.

## Option 3: Minimal Server

```bash
cd modern-diy-recipes
npm run server:minimal
```

This runs a lightweight version of the server.

## Option 4: Terminal Interface

```bash
cd modern-diy-recipes
bash start-kraft-terminal.sh
```

This starts the terminal interface specifically.

## Option 5: Using HTTP-Server Package

```bash
cd modern-diy-recipes
npx http-server -p 3000 public/
```

This serves the static files from the public directory.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Port Already In Use**: If port 3000 is in use, kill the process:
   ```bash
   kill $(lsof -t -i:3000)
   ```

2. **Network Interface Binding**: Try binding to a specific interface:
   ```bash
   NODE_IP=127.0.0.1 npm run server
   ```

3. **Using a Different Port**: If port 3000 is consistently problematic:
   ```bash
   bash start-port-8080.sh
   ```

4. **Network Restrictions**: Some corporate or university networks restrict localhost bindings. Try:
   ```bash
   bash start-any-host.sh
   ```

## Finished Settings Module

The Settings module implementation is now complete with all necessary UI components:
- Progress component
- RadioGroup component
- Tabs component
- Select component
- Switch component

These components are now properly implemented without external dependencies, allowing the application to function correctly.

## Opening in Browser

Once the server is running, open your browser to the appropriate URL (either http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:8080 depending on which method you used).
