=== Recommendations ===
[2025-05-10T02:48:26.756Z] 1. Create missing tables using the Supabase dashboard SQL editor
[2025-05-10T02:48:26.756Z]    See table structure in database.sql or create-tables-fixed.js
[2025-05-10T02:48:26.756Z] 1. Create the exec_sql function in the Supabase dashboard:
[2025-05-10T02:48:26.756Z] 
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.exec_sql(sql text)
RETURNS SETOF record
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY EXECUTE sql;
END;
$$;
