# Layout Fix Report

## Issues Fixed

1. **Formula Database 500 Error**
   - Resolved the issue with the Formula Database page returning 500 errors
   - Fixed the incompatible `use client` directive in the layout.tsx file that was conflicting with metadata export
   - Properly implemented the layout as a server component with correct metadata export

2. **3-Column Layout Architecture**
   - Implemented proper CSS Grid layout for the 3-column structure
   - Used appropriate `minmax()` values to ensure columns maintain their proper widths:
     - Left column: `minmax(250px, 1fr)`
     - Middle column: `minmax(500px, 3fr)`
     - Right column: `minmax(250px, 1fr)`
   - Added proper border styling to clearly delineate the columns
   - Ensured all components display correctly within the layout structure

## Testing Verification

- **Server Status**: The application server is running stably with no errors
- **URL Testing**: Both homepage and Formula Database return 200 status codes
- **Visual Verification**: Screenshots captured for:
  - Homepage layout with 3-column structure
  - Formula Database page

## Data Integration

- Formula Database now correctly integrates with the API services
- Recipe and ingredient data is being properly fetched and displayed
- Supabase database connection is working correctly
- API endpoints are returning expected data

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring for any layout issues in edge cases
2. Consider implementing responsive design improvements for mobile devices
3. Add additional unit tests to verify layout functionality
4. Document the layout architecture for future reference
