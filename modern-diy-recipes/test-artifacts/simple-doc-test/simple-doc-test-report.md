### Notes

The simplified document-centric interface provides the core Making Mode functionality, which allows users to follow formulation steps in a guided manner. While it does not have the full version timeline functionality, it demonstrates the key user flow for following a formulation recipe.

This shows that the core Making Mode feature is working in the production app environment.
