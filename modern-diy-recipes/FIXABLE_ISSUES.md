# Identified Server Issues and Fixes

Based on detailed diagnostics, we've identified several key issues affecting the server stability and connectivity:

## 1. Circular Dependencies

The diagnostic tool found circular dependencies in the codebase. These circular imports can cause initialization issues, especially during server-side rendering.

### Fixes:
- Break circular dependencies by using a shared types file
- Implement the safe provider pattern documented in `STABILITY_FIX.md`
- Use DOM attributes for cross-provider communication instead of direct imports

## 2. SSR/Browser API Access Issues

Multiple components are accessing browser APIs outside of useEffect hooks, which causes errors during server-side rendering:

- localStorage accessed directly in test files
- document accessed outside useEffect
- Other browser APIs potentially used during SSR

### Fixes:
- Add proper `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks before accessing browser APIs
- Move browser API access into useEffect hooks with empty dependency arrays
- Use the mounted state pattern to prevent hydration mismatches
- Add proper error handling around all browser API access

## 3. Next.js Configuration Issues

The Next.js configuration is ignoring TypeScript errors, which could hide critical issues:

```typescript
// next.config.ts
typescript: {
  ignoreBuildErrors: true,
}
```

### Fixes:
- Address the actual TypeScript errors instead of ignoring them
- If necessary for MCP integration, isolate the MCP-related code better
- Use proper TypeScript module declarations for problematic modules

## 4. Server Startup Issues

The Next.js server is taking too long to start or getting stuck during initialization:

- Failed to start within 60 seconds during the memory test
- May be related to expensive operations during initialization

### Fixes:
- Implement proper lazy loading for heavy components
- Move expensive operations out of the module scope and into initialization functions
- Separate the MCP initialization from the main application startup
- Use Next.js' built-in performance optimization features

## 5. Testing Environment Issues

Multiple test files are accessing browser APIs directly, which can cause issues when running tests in different environments:

- localStorage and document being accessed in test files without proper mocks
- This can cause test failures and potentially impact server stability

### Fixes:
- Add proper mocks for browser APIs in test files
- Use test environment configuration to prevent test code from affecting production
- Separate test utilities from production code

## Implementation Approach

To fix these issues systematically:

1. **Fix Provider Hierarchy**:
   - Follow the pattern documented in `STABILITY_FIX.md`
   - Ensure proper parent-child relationships between providers
   - Use the ConsolidatedThemeProvider approach

2. **Implement SSR Safety**:
   - Add proper checks before accessing browser APIs:
   ```typescript
   if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
     // Safe to access browser APIs here
   }
   ```
   - Use mounted state to prevent hydration mismatches:
   ```typescript
   const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);
   
   useEffect(() => {
     setMounted(true);
   }, []);
   
   if (!mounted) {
     // Return a simple placeholder or null during SSR
     return <div className="loading-placeholder" />;
   }
   ```

3. **Optimize Server Startup**:
   - Use dynamic imports for heavy components
   - Implement proper code splitting
   - Separate MCP initialization from critical path

4. **Improve Testing**:
   - Add proper mocks for browser APIs in test files
   - Use Jest's moduleNameMapper to provide mock implementations

## Test Plan

After implementing these fixes:

1. Run the diagnostic tool again to verify circular dependencies are resolved
2. Test the server startup time with `time npm run dev`
3. Verify server accessibility with curl and browser tests
4. Run the test suite to ensure all tests pass with the fixes
