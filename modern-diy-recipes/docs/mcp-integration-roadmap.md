# MCP Integration Roadmap

This document outlines the plan for integrating additional Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers into the DIY Recipes application. The MCP architecture allows the application to leverage external AI capabilities and services through a standardized interface.

## Current MCP Integrations

We have successfully implemented the following MCP integrations:

- **GitHub MCP** - Provides repository and code management, used for recipe version control
- **Puppeteer MCP** - Enables browser automation for visual previews and screenshots
- **Supabase MCP** - Provides database, auth, and storage operations
- **Vercel MCP** - Supports deployment and project management

## Next Phase Integrations

The following MCP integrations are prioritized for the next development phase:

1. **Brave Search MCP**
   - Purpose: Enhanced recipe and ingredient search capabilities
   - Priority: High
   - Components to update:
     - Recipe search functionality
     - Ingredient database lookup
     - Recipe recommendation engine

2. **Memory MCP**
   - Purpose: Persistent memory across sessions for improved user experiences
   - Priority: Medium
   - Components to update:
     - User preference tracking
     - Recipe history management
     - Previous searches and recommendations

3. **Filesystem MCP**
   - Purpose: Improved file operations for recipe imports/exports
   - Priority: Medium
   - Components to update:
     - Recipe import/export functionality
     - Bulk operations on recipes
     - Local backup system

## Future Integrations

These integrations are planned for future development:

1. **Sequential Thinking MCP**
   - Purpose: Complex reasoning for recipe analysis and optimization
   - Priority: Medium
   - Use cases:
     - Nutritional analysis 
     - Ingredient substitution reasoning
     - Recipe scaling logic

2. **Google Maps MCP**
   - Purpose: Location-based features
   - Priority: Low
   - Use cases:
     - Ingredient sourcing location
     - Local recipe variants
     - Regional ingredient substitutions

3. **Slack MCP**
   - Purpose: Collaboration and notifications
   - Priority: Low
   - Use cases:
     - Team recipe collaboration
     - Cooking timers and notifications
     - Recipe sharing

## Implementation Approach

For each new MCP integration, we will follow this standardized approach:

1. **Adapter Implementation**
   - Create the TypeScript adapter class extending BaseMcpAdapter
   - Define type-safe interfaces for all MCP functions
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Factory Registration**
   - Add the adapter to the MCP adapter factory
   - Add singleton instance management
   - Update the connection management

3. **Provider Integration**
   - Update the McpProvider to expose the new adapter
   - Add proper initialization and cleanup

4. **Component Development**
   - Create demonstration components
   - Update existing components to leverage new capabilities
   - Add navigation and discovery of new features

5. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for the adapter
   - Add integration tests for components
   - Document test scenarios

## Architecture Evolution

As we add more MCP integrations, we will evolve the architecture to handle:

- **Adapter Federation**: Managing multiple adapters with similar capabilities
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when MCPs are unavailable
- **Performance Optimization**: Connection pooling and request batching
- **Security**: Proper credential management for MCP servers
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance tracking

## MCP Engineering Best Practices

1. **Standardized Error Handling**
   - Categorize errors by type (connection, execution, validation)
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures

2. **Type Safety**
   - Maintain comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
   - Validate responses against expected schemas
   - Handle unexpected response formats gracefully

3. **Selective Initialization**
   - Lazy-load MCP adapters on demand
   - Implement connection timeouts
   - Support user-controlled initialization
   
4. **Documentation**
   - Document each MCP function with examples
   - Include parameter definitions and constraints
   - Provide troubleshooting guides

## Implementation Schedule

| MCP Server | Target Completion | Required Resources |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Brave Search | Q2 2023 | 1 developer, 2 weeks |
| Memory | Q2 2023 | 1 developer, 1 week |
| Filesystem | Q2 2023 | 1 developer, 1 week |
| Sequential Thinking | Q3 2023 | 1 developer, 2 weeks |
| Google Maps | Q3 2023 | 1 developer, 1 week |
| Slack | Q4 2023 | 1 developer, 1 week |

## Conclusion

The MCP integration strategy provides DIY Recipes with a scalable and standardized approach to leveraging AI capabilities and external services. By following this roadmap, we will methodically enhance the application's capabilities while maintaining a clean architecture and excellent user experience.
