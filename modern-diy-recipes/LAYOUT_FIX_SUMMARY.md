# Layout Architecture Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Implemented Proper 3-Column Layout**
   - Replaced custom Tailwind grid implementation with the proper CSS Grid layout from style.css
   - Used the `content-grid` class which ensures consistent column widths and spacing
   - Added proper column classes: `left-column`, `middle-column`, and `right-column`
   - Fixed height and overflow issues to ensure all columns are properly displayed

2. **Added Appropriate Headers**
   - Added "RECIPE MANAGEMENT" header to the left column
   - Added "Settings" header to the right column
   - Ensured consistent styling with the design system

3. **Removed UI Clutter**
   - Removed the floating links that were cluttering the interface
   - Ensured focus on the core 3-column interface

4. **Fixed Server Issues**
   - Resolved the 500 errors that were occurring when accessing the application
   - Used the stable server script to ensure consistent server performance

## Implementation Details

The key change was moving from a custom Tailwind grid implementation to using the pre-defined CSS Grid layout in style.css. This ensures consistency with the overall design system and maintains the proper column proportions:

```css
/* From style.css */
.content-grid {
  display: grid;
  /* Fixed sidebars, flexible middle */
  grid-template-columns: minmax(250px, 1fr) 3fr minmax(250px, 1fr);
  gap: var(--spacing-medium);
  padding: var(--spacing-medium);
  max-width: var(--max-width);
  margin: 0 auto;
  flex: 1;
  overflow: hidden;
  height: 100%;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}
```

## Verification

The layout has been thoroughly tested and verified:
- The server is running stably without 500 errors
- All three columns display correctly with proper proportions
- Recipe data loads correctly in the middle column
- Settings panel displays properly in the right column
- The application maintains a cohesive visual appearance

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring for any layout issues
2. Implement responsive design improvements for mobile devices if needed
3. Consider adding additional styling to further enhance the visual consistency
