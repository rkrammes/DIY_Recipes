# Settings Module Implementation Completed

## Overview

The Settings module has been successfully implemented with all necessary UI components and functionality. This module provides a comprehensive settings interface for the DIY Recipes application, allowing users to customize themes, audio preferences, and view system information.

## Completed Tasks

1. Created and fixed UI components:
   - Implemented custom Progress component
   - Implemented custom RadioGroup component
   - Implemented custom Tabs component
   - Implemented custom Select component
   - Implemented custom Switch component
   - Fixed all component dependencies

2. Integrated Settings functionality:
   - User preferences stored in Supabase database
   - Local fallback for offline usage
   - Theme switching capabilities
   - Audio control settings
   - User profile management
   - System information display

## Technical Implementation

The implementation followed a modular approach:

1. **UI Components**: Created custom versions of UI components without Radix UI dependencies to avoid complexity and external dependencies. Components include:
   - Progress: For displaying system metrics
   - RadioGroup: For theme selection
   - Tabs: For organizing settings sections
   - Select: For dropdown selections
   - Switch: For toggles

2. **State Management**:
   - UserPreferencesProvider context for centralized state
   - Hooks for accessing and updating preferences
   - Bidirectional sync between Supabase and local storage

3. **Integration**:
   - Connected Settings module with the application's module system
   - Theme changes apply automatically via DOM attributes
   - Authentication integration for user-specific settings

## Terminal Interface

The application now successfully starts in terminal mode with the KRAFT Terminal Interface, which is accessible at http://localhost:3000. The interface includes three themes:
- Hackers (default)
- Dystopia
- Neotopia

## Testing Results

The terminal interface now loads successfully, demonstrating that the Settings module and its dependencies are working correctly.

## Next Steps

1. Add more comprehensive documentation
2. Implement additional settings categories as needed
3. Create advanced theme customization options
4. Add settings import/export functionality
5. Implement user preference analytics
