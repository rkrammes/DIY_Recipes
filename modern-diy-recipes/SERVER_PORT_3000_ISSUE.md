# Port 3000 Access Issue Report

## Issue Summary

There appears to be an issue with accessing services on port 3000 on this machine. While we can start servers that bind to port 3000 without errors, we cannot connect to them using either localhost, 127.0.0.1, or the machine's IP address. This issue is accompanied by Supabase configuration problems.

## Port 3000 Access Issue

### Diagnostics Run

1. **Basic Next.js Server**
   - Started Next.js with explicit port 3000 setting
   - Server appeared to start successfully
   - Could not access via browser or curl

2. **Simple HTTP Server**
   - Created and ran a basic Node.js HTTP server on port 3000
   - Server appeared to start successfully
   - Could not access via browser or curl

3. **Minimal Test Server**
   - Created a minimal Node.js HTTP server that explicitly binds to 0.0.0.0:3000
   - Server appeared to start successfully
   - Could not access via browser or curl

### Potential Causes

1. **Firewall Blocking Port 3000**
   - macOS firewall might be blocking incoming connections to port 3000
   - Network firewall might be blocking connections

2. **Network Interface Issues**
   - There might be issues with the network interfaces or routing
   - localhost/127.0.0.1 loopback might not be working properly

3. **Port Already In Use**
   - Another service (like AirPlay Receiver which uses port 3000) might be using the port
   - Port might be reserved by the system

4. **Environment Constraints**
   - The development environment might have restrictions on port access
   - Virtual machine or container might have network isolation

## Supabase Configuration Issues

In addition to the port 3000 issue, we've identified several issues with the Supabase configuration:

1. **Security Issue**: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `.env.local` is actually a service role key
   - This is a security risk as it exposes admin-level database access to client-side code
   - Service role keys should never be exposed in client-side code

2. **Missing Database Resources**:
   - The `user_preferences` table is missing from the Supabase database
   - The `exec_sql` function is missing, which prevents setup scripts from running

3. **Lack of Transparent Error Handling**:
   - Errors were not being displayed properly
   - The Settings module didn't show Supabase connection status

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Working Port Script

We've created a new script `start-on-working-port.sh` that:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Uses port 8080 instead of 3000
export PORT=8080
export NEXT_PUBLIC_PORT=8080
# ...other environment variables
npx next dev -p 8080 -H 0.0.0.0
```

This script can be run with:
```bash
./start-on-working-port.sh
```

It also accepts the same parameters as the original start script:
```bash
./start-on-working-port.sh --use-mock-data
./start-on-working-port.sh --dev-auth
```

### 2. Supabase Security Enhancements

1. **Updated supabaseConfig.ts**:
   - Added detection for service role keys used in client contexts
   - Provides clear security warnings
   - Improves validation of configuration

2. **Created supabaseValidator.ts**:
   - Provides comprehensive validation of Supabase setup
   - Detects security issues
   - Validates table existence

3. **Enhanced useUserPreferences.ts**:
   - Added `supabaseAvailable` state tracking
   - Implemented transparent error handling
   - Falls back to localStorage when Supabase is unavailable

### 3. Fixed Database Setup Script

The `setup-preferences-table.js` script has been tested and works, but does report errors related to the missing `exec_sql` function. Despite these errors, it successfully checks if the table exists.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Use the Working Port Script**:
   ```bash
   ./start-on-working-port.sh
   ```

2. **Fix Supabase Configuration**:
   - Update `.env.local` with the correct anon key (not service role key)
   - Keep the service role key for server-side operations only
   - Create required database tables using the Supabase dashboard SQL editor

3. **Implement Transparent Error Handling**:
   - Our implementation already shows actual errors rather than hiding them
   - This helps diagnose issues with Supabase connectivity

## Application Status

The environment validator system has been successfully implemented and is ready for use with the application. We've also implemented fixes for the Supabase configuration issues. The application can be accessed on port 8080 using our new script, bypassing the port 3000 issues.

The transparent error handling approach enables the application to function even when Supabase is unavailable, using localStorage as a fallback while displaying the actual connection errors to assist in debugging.
