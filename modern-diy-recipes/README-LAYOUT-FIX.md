# DIY Recipes Layout Fix

This document summarizes the layout fixes implemented for the DIY Recipes application.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Formula Database 500 Error**
   - Resolved the issue with the Formula Database page returning 500 errors
   - Fixed by converting the layout component from a client component to a server component
   - Properly implemented metadata export according to Next.js standards

2. **3-Column Layout Architecture**
   - Implemented a proper CSS Grid layout for the 3-column structure
   - Used appropriate `minmax()` values to ensure responsive but stable column widths:
     ```css
     grid-cols-[minmax(250px,1fr)_minmax(500px,3fr)_minmax(250px,1fr)]
     ```
   - Added proper border styling and overflow handling

## Implementation Details

### Formula Database Layout Fix

The key issue with the Formula Database page was mixing `use client` directive with metadata exports in the layout file. This was fixed by:

1. Removing the `use client` directive from the layout.tsx file
2. Properly exporting metadata as a server component
3. Ensuring the layout integrates with the app's theme system

### Homepage Layout Fix

The 3-column layout was improved by:

1. Using CSS Grid instead of flexbox for more predictable layout behavior
2. Setting appropriate minimum widths to prevent columns from collapsing
3. Implementing proper overflow handling for scrollable content
4. Ensuring responsive behavior while maintaining column proportions

## Testing and Verification

The fixes were verified using:

1. Server response testing with curl
2. Visual screenshot verification using Puppeteer
3. Server logs to confirm proper page rendering
4. Manual testing of navigation and layout behavior

## Screenshots

Screenshots are available in the `test-artifacts` directory:
- `homepage-layout.png`: Shows the fixed 3-column layout
- `formula-database-layout.png`: Shows the properly rendering Formula Database page

## Next Steps

1. Consider implementing responsive design improvements for smaller screen sizes
2. Add additional unit tests to verify layout functionality
3. Document the layout architecture for future reference
