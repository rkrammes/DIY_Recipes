# Document-Centric Formulation Interface

This document explains how to use and test the new document-centric formulation interface that has been implemented in the DIY Recipes application.

## Overview

The document-centric interface provides a unified view for working with DIY formulations (soaps, creams, bath bombs, etc.) that integrates:

1. **Reading**: View the formulation in a clean, document-like format
2. **Editing**: Make inline changes to any section without mode switching
3. **Version Timeline**: See and navigate between different iterations of a formulation
4. **Making Mode**: Get step-by-step guidance with timers while making the formulation
5. **AI Suggestions**: Receive contextual improvement suggestions for your formulation
6. **Print Support**: Create printer-friendly versions of formulations for physical reference

This interface replaces modal-based editing with a cohesive document view that supports all these functions simultaneously.

## Testing the Interface

To test the new document-centric interface:

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/ryankrammes/Kraft_AI (App)/DIY_Recipes/modern-diy-recipes"
   ./start-document-mode.sh
   ```

2. **Open in browser**:
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/document-view?id=1
   - This will open the DIY Moisturizing Soap Bar formulation in the new interface

3. **Try the features**:
   - **Inline Editing**: Click the pencil icon next to any section title to edit
   - **Making Mode**: Click the "Making Mode" button in the header to see step-by-step instructions
   - **Version Timeline**: Use the timeline to navigate between different iterations
   - **Ingredient Management**: Add, edit, or remove ingredients
   - **AI Suggestions**: Click "Get suggestions" links to see improvement ideas
   - **Print Support**: Use the Print button to print the formulation or use Print Preview for a new tab view

## Making Mode Features

The Making Mode is designed specifically for when you're actively creating a DIY product:

- **Step-by-Step Navigation**: Move forward and back through procedure steps
- **Scaled Ingredients**: Easily adjust quantities with scale controls (0.5×, 1×, 2×, 3×)
- **Timers**: Set timers for steps that require exact timing
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Use arrow keys to navigate steps, space to toggle timers

## Implementation Details

This interface was built with DIY product formulation in mind:

- Terminology focuses on "making" rather than "cooking"
- Ingredients can be measured in various units (oz, g, drops, etc.)
- Supports chemical processes like saponification with appropriate warnings
- Tracks metrics like pH levels, hardness, and cure times

## Print Support Features

The print functionality offers several benefits for DIY formulation makers:

- **Direct Printing**: Use the Print button for immediate printing via the browser
- **Print Preview**: Open a clean, printable version in a new tab
- **Auto-formatting**: Automatically formats the document for print media
- **Clean Layout**: Removes UI controls, navigation, and non-essential elements when printing
- **Useful Metadata**: Includes version number, date printed, and other essential information

Printing a formulation is especially useful when:
- Following instructions in a workshop or making area
- Sharing formulations with others who don't have digital access
- Creating a physical recipe book of your favorite formulations
- Taking notes while making the product

## Future Improvements

Future iterations of this interface could include:

- Step-by-step photos for visual guidance
- Ingredient substitution suggestions
- Safety warnings for potentially hazardous ingredients
- QR code generation for sharing formulations
- Enhanced printable templates with custom formatting options

## Feedback

Please provide feedback on how this document-centric approach works for your DIY formulation workflow, particularly regarding:

1. The unification of viewing and editing
2. The utility of Making Mode for step-by-step guidance
3. The effectiveness of the version timeline for tracking iterations
4. Any parts of the interface that could be improved or simplified
