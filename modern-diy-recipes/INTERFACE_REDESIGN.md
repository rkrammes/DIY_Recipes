## Technical Implementation

The design was implemented using:
- CSS Flexbox for layout structure
- Proper semantic HTML for accessibility
- Responsive design principles
- Content centered for optimal viewing

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Focus on Core User Journey:**
   - Optimized for the primary use case (viewing and editing recipes)
   - Removed distractions and unnecessary elements

2. **Content-First Approach:**
   - Recipe details are given prominence with proper width constraints
   - Better information hierarchy

3. **Simplified Navigation:**
   - Eliminated excess navigation options
   - Focused on the main sections users need

4. **Modern Aesthetics:**
   - Maintained the app's sci-fi theme while improving usability
   - Added subtle interface elements that enhance without distracting

## Mobile Considerations

The new design is more adaptable to smaller screens:
- The two-panel layout can stack vertically on mobile
- Content is properly constrained to prevent overflow issues
- UI elements use appropriate sizing for touch interactions
