# Document-Centric Interface: How to Access

The document-centric interface for DIY formulations has been implemented and is accessible in the running app on port 3000. This guide explains how to find and use the different implementations.

## Quick Access URLs

The document-centric interface is available at these URLs:

1. **Simple Document View**: [http://localhost:3000/simple-doc](http://localhost:3000/simple-doc)
   - Basic version with Making Mode but no timeline

2. **Document Test Page**: [http://localhost:3000/document-test](http://localhost:3000/document-test)
   - Full version with mock iterations for the version timeline

3. **Document View**: [http://localhost:3000/document-view?id=1](http://localhost:3000/document-view?id=1)
   - Full version with database integration (requires database)

4. **Navigation Hub**: [http://localhost:3000/document-interface](http://localhost:3000/document-interface)
   - Central page with links to all document interface implementations

## Finding the Interface

1. **From the Homepage**: 
   - Look for the blue "Document-Centric Interface" banner in the bottom-right corner
   - Click "View Document Interface" to access the navigation hub

2. **Direct URL**: 
   - Navigate directly to any of the Quick Access URLs above

## Key Features to Try

1. **Making Mode**:
   - Click the "Making Mode" button in the document header
   - Navigate through steps with the Next/Previous buttons
   - Try scaling ingredients with the 2× button
   - Exit Making Mode when finished

2. **Version Timeline** (in document-test):
   - Look for version buttons (v1, v2, v3) in the timeline section
   - Click different versions to see content changes
   - Try creating a new version with the "Create New Version" button

3. **Print Functionality**:
   - Find the Print button in the document header
   - Try Print Preview to open a formatted version in a new tab

## Testing the Interface

To verify the interface is working:

1. Run the simplified test:
   ```bash
   node test-simple-doc-fixed.js
   ```

2. Run the comprehensive test:
   ```bash
   node test-document-iterations-complete.js
   ```

These tests will generate screenshots and reports in the `test-artifacts` directory.

## Implementation Status

- ✅ Simple document view with Making Mode works correctly
- ✅ Document test page with mock iterations demonstrates version timeline
- ✅ Print functionality implemented and tested
- ✅ Integrated into the app with navigation links and banner

The document-centric interface is now fully implemented and accessible in the running application, with both the simplified version and full version available for testing.
