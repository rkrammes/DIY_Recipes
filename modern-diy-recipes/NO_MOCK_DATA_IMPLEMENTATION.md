# No Mock Data Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to implement the "no mock data rule" in the KRAFT_AI Terminal interface.

## Database Schema Changes
- Added `tools` and `library` tables to the database schema in `init-db-tables.sql`
- Created sample data for all tables including recipes, ingredients, tools, and library items
- Ensure all data displayed in the UI comes from real database sources

## Missing Tables Issue
When running the interface, you may encounter an issue where the 'tools' and 'library' tables don't exist in your Supabase database. This is because these tables need to be created separately from the 'recipes' and 'ingredients' tables that may already exist.

### How to Fix Missing Tables

You can fix this issue in two ways:

1. **Run the Database Setup Script (Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   # This will create the missing tables using the service role key
   node create-missing-tables.js
   ```

2. **Run SQL in Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Open your Supabase dashboard
   - Go to the SQL Editor
   - Copy the contents of `init-db-tables.sql` file
   - Run the SQL commands

## KraftTerminalModularLayout Component Changes

### Database Connection Handling
- Added explicit database connection status tracking with three states:
  - 'checking': When attempting to connect to database
  - 'online': When successfully connected
  - 'offline': When connection fails

### Error Transparency
- Added clear error display in UI when database connection fails
- Stores and shows the specific error message returned from Supabase
- Shows detailed error information in the terminal interface

### Zero Mock Data Policy
- Removed all hardcoded item arrays
- Only displays data retrieved from the database
- Shows empty state messages when tables exist but have no data
- Shows connection error when database is unavailable

### Visual Status Indicators
- Added color-coded status indicators throughout the interface:
  - Amber/yellow for 'checking' state
  - Green for 'online' state
  - Red for 'offline' state
  
### Full Data Integration
- Unified database stats tracking across all data types
- Added tracking for tools and library items alongside formulations and ingredients
- Implemented proper error handling for all database queries

## How to Test
1. Run the database script in Supabase SQL Editor to create all necessary tables
2. Start the application and observe the database connection process
3. Verify that only real data is displayed when connection succeeds
4. Verify that clear error messages are shown when connection fails

## Implementation Notes
This implementation fully adheres to the "no mock data rule" by only displaying data that comes directly from the database. All parts of the UI show appropriate loading, empty, or error states based on the actual database connection status.
