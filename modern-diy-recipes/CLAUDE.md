# Project Memory for Claude Code

## Development Guidelines

1. Always use Context7 for documentation lookup before implementing features
2. Understand that Context7 is a development tool, not a runtime component
3. Use TodoWrite/TodoRead to track tasks consistently
4. Check documentation before implementing authentication features

## Project Structure

- Context7 provides documentation access via useContext7Mcp hook
- Authentication is handled by the AuthProvider
