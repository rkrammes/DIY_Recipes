# Recipe Feature Toggle System

This document explains the implementation of the recipe versioning feature toggle system for the DIY Recipes application.

## Overview

The feature toggle system allows users to enable or disable recipe versioning functionality through a user-friendly UI component. This approach makes the versioning feature optional while ensuring it's easy to discover and use.

## Components

1. **FeatureToggleBar Component**
   - Located at: `src/components/FeatureToggleBar.tsx`
   - Provides a toggle UI for enabling/disabling recipe versioning
   - Uses localStorage to persist user preferences

2. **RecipeDetails Integration**
   - Modified `src/components/RecipeDetails.tsx` to conditionally render versioning UI
   - Includes a clear call-to-action when versioning is disabled
   - Responds to toggle state changes in real-time

3. **Local Storage Persistence**
   - User preferences are stored in browser localStorage
   - Key: `recipeFeatures` with value: `{"versioning": true|false}`
   - Ensures settings persist between page refreshes and sessions

## Testing

A comprehensive testing approach has been implemented:

1. **Standalone Demo**
   - `feature-toggle-demo.html`: Self-contained demo for testing the UI
   - Can be served with `serve-demo.js` on port 3005

2. **Automated Testing**
   - `test-demo.js`: Puppeteer script that tests feature toggle functionality
   - Verifies UI changes, localStorage persistence, and toggle behavior
   - Creates screenshots in `test-artifacts/feature-toggle-demo/`

3. **Full App Testing**
   - `test-feature-toggle.js`: Tests integration with the main application
   - Navigates to recipe details and tests the feature toggle

## How to Test

### Running the Demo

1. Start the demo server:
   ```
   node serve-demo.js
   ```

2. Open http://localhost:3005 in your browser

### Running Automated Tests

Run the complete test with:
```
./run-feature-toggle-demo.sh
```

Or run individual components:
```
node serve-demo.js  # Start the demo server
node test-demo.js   # Run the demo tests
```

## Implementation Notes

1. The feature toggle uses a dropdown settings menu for a clean UI
2. Toggle state is persisted in localStorage to remember user preferences
3. The UI provides clear feedback about what versioning does
4. When disabled, a prominent button makes it easy to enable

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding additional features to the toggle bar (e.g., recipe sharing, AI suggestions)
2. Add server-side persistence for logged-in users
3. Track analytics on feature usage to inform future development
