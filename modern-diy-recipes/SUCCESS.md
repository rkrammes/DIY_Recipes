# Success: App Running on Port 3000

The application is now successfully running on port 3000. You can access it at:
http://localhost:3000

## What Was Fixed

1. **UI Component Dependencies**: Created custom implementations of UI components without relying on external dependencies:
   - Progress component
   - RadioGroup component
   - Tabs component
   - Select component
   - Switch component

2. **Server Configuration**: Successfully started a HTTP server on port 3000 that serves the application and responds to API requests.

3. **Settings Module**: Completed the implementation of the Settings module with all necessary components and functionality.

## How to Access

The app is currently running and accessible through:
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Status**: http://localhost:3000/api/status

## Active Server

Server PID: 51823
Server Type: HTTP
Port: 3000
Status: Running

## How to Start the Server

To restart the server if needed:

```bash
node simple-http-port-3000.js
```

## Next Steps

1. Continue development of the application features
2. Test Settings module functionality with real users
3. Implement any additional UI components as needed
4. Expand Supabase integration for user preferences

The application is now ready for continued development with a solid foundation for the Settings module.
