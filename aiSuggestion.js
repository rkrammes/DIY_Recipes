 * @returns {Promise<string>} - A promise that resolves to an AI-generated suggestion.
 *
 * Big Picture:
 *   This function serves as the core of the AI suggestion module. It processes the ingredient list,
 *   potentially using a machine learning model or an external API, and returns a recommendation that
 *   could be applied to improve the recipe.
