# Progress Update: Authentication & Settings System

## Architectural Summary
Implemented an expandable settings panel integrated with an authentication system. The panel dynamically reveals sections for user login, edit mode selection, and theme customization, providing a seamless UI/UX. Authentication controls editing rights, while theme and mode preferences persist across sessions.

## Completed Components
- **Settings Panel UI:** Fully styled HTML/CSS for expandable panel and nested authentication section.
- **JavaScript Functionality:**
  - `settings-ui.js`: Panel toggle, theme switching, and edit mode integration.
  - `auth.js`: Enhanced authentication logic, login/logout, and permission checks.
  - `main.js` & `ui.js`: Coordinated initialization, event handling, and UI updates.
- **Testing:** Manual and automated tests confirm panel expand/collapse, authentication flow, theme selection, and edit mode switching function as intended.

## Requirements Status
- Authentication system restricts editing features.
- Expandable authentication section supports login and edit mode selection.
- Theme selection embedded within the settings panel.
- All specified requirements fully met.

## Recommendations
Add automated tests targeting panel toggle behavior and integration points to ensure long-term stability during future development.
