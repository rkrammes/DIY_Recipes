# MCP Server Verification Report

**Date:** April 6, 2025

This report details the verification process for MCP servers configured in `mcp_settings.json` for the DIY Recipes project.

## 1. Configured Servers & Startup Commands

Based on `/Users/ryankrammes/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/mcp_settings.json`:

### GitHub (`github`)
```bash
# Command from settings: npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
# Requires GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable (set in settings)
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
```

### Brave Search (`brave-search`)
```bash
# Command from settings: npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search
# Requires BRAVE_API_KEY environment variable (set in settings)
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search
```

### Puppeteer (`puppeteer`)
```bash
# Command from settings: npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer
```

### Supabase Custom (`supabase-custom`)
```bash
# Command from settings: node /Users/ryankrammes/Documents/GitHub/DIY_Recipes/mcp-servers/supabase-mcp-server.js
# Requires environment variables set in settings (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY, etc.)
# Note: Script located at ./mcp-servers/supabase-mcp-server.js
node mcp-servers/supabase-mcp-server.js
```
*Note: The settings file was updated during verification to use the correct command, arguments, environment variables, and port for the Supabase Custom server.*

## 2. Roo Code MCP Servers Tab & Functionality Verification

Verification was performed by attempting to use basic tools for each configured server via Roo Code.

**Verification Result (April 6, 2025):**

*   **GitHub (`github`):**
    *   Visible/Registered in Roo Code MCP Servers tab: **Assumed Yes** (Based on successful tool use)
    *   Functionality Test (`search_repositories`): **Success**
    *   Status: **Verified Functional**

*   **Brave Search (`brave-search`):**
    *   Visible/Registered in Roo Code MCP Servers tab: **Assumed Yes** (Based on successful tool use)
    *   Functionality Test (`brave_web_search`): **Success**
    *   Status: **Verified Functional**

*   **Puppeteer (`puppeteer`):**
    *   Visible/Registered in Roo Code MCP Servers tab: **Assumed Yes** (Based on successful tool use)
    *   Functionality Test (`puppeteer_navigate`): **Success**
    *   Status: **Verified Functional**

*   **Supabase Custom (`supabase-custom`):**
    *   Visible/Registered in Roo Code MCP Servers tab: **Assumed Yes** (Configuration exists)
    *   Functionality Test (`get_schemas`): **Failed** (Persistent "Not connected" error)
    *   Troubleshooting Steps Taken:
        1.  Verified script exists (`mcp-servers/supabase-mcp-server.js`).
        2.  Attempted manual start (failed due to module type mismatch).
        3.  Updated script to use ES Module `import` syntax.
        4.  Updated `mcp_settings.json`: Corrected `command` to `node`.
        5.  Updated `mcp_settings.json`: Added script path to `args`.
        6.  Updated `mcp_settings.json`: Added required `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` from `.env` to `env` block.
        7.  Stopped manually started server process.
        8.  Updated `mcp_settings.json`: Changed script path in `args` to absolute path.
        9.  Updated `mcp_settings.json`: Explicitly added `port: 3002`.
    *   Status: **Verification Failed** (Roo Code cannot connect despite configuration updates)

## 3. Run Verification Script (`verify-mcp-servers.js`)

*Note: This script may need updating to include tests for Brave Search and Puppeteer servers and to reflect the correct Supabase server name (`supabase-custom`). The previous run used mock responses.*

Executing the script as-is would likely show success for GitHub and failure/mock success for Supabase based on its current implementation. Live testing via Roo Code is more accurate.

## 4. Screenshots / Terminal Output

*Screenshots of the Roo Code MCP Servers tab showing the status of each server would be beneficial here.*

*Terminal output for the successful tests (GitHub, Brave, Puppeteer) and the "Not connected" errors for Supabase Custom were observed during the interactive verification process.*
